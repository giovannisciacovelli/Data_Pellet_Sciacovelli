No data on external bonds are available between 1921 and 1923.  Internal Bond data during World War I is provided by the Austria 4% Gold Rente (BGAUT4G-WN). <br />After the Austro-Hungarian Empire collapsed after World War I, interest payments were suspended in 1919, the debt of the empire was allocated among the surviving countries.  Also, interest payments were adjusted for outstanding bonds.  Bonds in paper krone were paid at face value which because of Austria`s hyperinflation made the bonds worthless; bonds payable in Gold Krone paid 32% of the original interest rate and bonds payable in foreign currencies were paid at 27% of the original interest rate. The debt was allocated among the Austrian Monarchy as follows: Austria (976,404,600 Krone), Czechosolovakia (898,724,400K), Poland (291,396,500K), Yugoslavia (32,939,200K), Romania (4,995,300K) and Italy (24,991,800K) with unsecured debt allocated 41.7% to Czechoslovakia, 36,827% to Austria, 13.733% to Poland, 4.087% to Italy, 2.043% to Yugoslavia and 1.61% to Romania.<br />The Austria 7% Bonds of 1923 due 1943 (BGAUT743) traded in New York is used from July to September 1923 and the Austria 6% Redeemable Loan of 1922 (BGAUT6-LO) which traded in London is used from October 1923 to November 1934, the Austria 4.5% Guaranteed Sterling Bond of 1934 (Redeemable 1959) (BGAUT4534-LO) is used from December 1934 to December 1957 and the Austria 4.50% Assented Bonds due 1980 (formerly 7% of 1930) (BGAUT4580) which traded in New York is used from January 1958 to December 1972.<br />The yield on Austrian government bonds traded in Zurich is used from 1964 through 1970. An index of all government bonds of more than one year, issued and not redeemed, is used beginning in 1971 to 1979 and a 10-year bond beginning in 1980.<br />Until 1872, Austrian bonds were denominated in either paper Florins or in Silver and depreciated as Austrian inflation increased.  Austria suspended payment on foreign bonds during World War I and provided reduced payments on bonds between 1939 and 1948, but renegotiated the bonds after each war. Internal bonds paid interest during the war, but inflation significantly reduced the value of the bonds.",
