IGUSA10D,USA 10-year Bond Constant Maturity Yield (with GFD Extension),Government Bond Yields,United States Dollar,United States,,,,,,,Percent per Annum,Units,Stock,none,Monthly From Jul 1786 To Dec 1961<BR>Daily From Jan 1962 To Mar 2022<BR>,"Sources: Richard E. Sylla, Jack Wilson and Robert E. Wright, Price Quotations in Early U.S. Securities Markets, 1790-1860, Hunt's Merchants Magazine (1843-1853), The Economist (1854-1861), The Financial Review (1862-1918), Federal Reserve Bank, National Monetary Statistics, New York: FRB, 1941, 1970 (annually thereafter); and Salomon Brothers, Analytical Record of Yields and Yield Spreads, New York: Salomon Brothers, 1995  Notes: The United States defaulted on its debt during the Revolutionary War and remained in default until its finances were reorganized by Alexander Hamilton through the Funding Act of 1790. The federal government assumed all the debts of the individual states and refunded the debt with 4/9ths in 6% bonds (trading at 70), 1/3rd in 3% bonds (trading at 36.75) and 2/9ths in Deferred 6% bonds (trading at 30) that didn't pay any interest until 1800. This worked out to $50 in exchange for $60 in Depreciated Unfunded or Continental Currency Bonds.  The United States 6% Depreciated Unfunded Bonds (BGUSA6DU) are used from August 1786 to September 1790 and paid no interest. The United States 3% Bonds of 1790 (BGUSA3S) are used from October 1790 to December 1832. From 1790 to 1832, the government generally ran surpluses and redeemed its outstanding debt.  By 1833, no debt was outstanding and no federal government bonds traded between 1833 and 1842. New York had the largest and most liquid debt during this period of time, so the New York 5% Canal Bonds due 1845 (BSNY5C45) is used between January 1833 and November 1842. New government bonds were introduced in 1843 and the federal government has had outstanding debt ever since. The United States 6% Bonds due 1862 (BGUSA662) are used between December 1842 and June 1848, the United States 6% Bonds of 1868 (BGUSA668) are used between July 1848 and July 1858, the United States 5% Bonds due 1874 (BGUSA574) are used between August 1858 and October 1860, the United States 6% Bonds of 1881 (BGUSA681) are used between November 1860 and December 1869, the United States 6% Bonds of 1896 Registered (BGUSA696) are used between January 1870 and June 1877, the United States 4% Bonds of 1907 with Coupons (BGUSA407C) are used between July 1877 and December 1895, the United States 4% Bonds of 1925 with Coupons (BGUSA425C) are used between January 1896 and November 1917, the United States 4% Liberty Loan of 1932-47 with coupons (BGUSA4L47) are used between November  1917 and December 1918. Beginning in 1919, the Federal Reserve Board's 10-15 year Treasury Bond index is used. 10 year bonds are used beginning in 1941.  Data for 1872 through 1918 are taken from the Financial Review. The interest rate series dating back to 1919 are taken from the Federal Reserve, National Monetary Statistics, New York: Federal Reserve Board which was published in 1941, 1970 and annually since then. <br />From 1941 on, the Fed's Index of 10-year bonds is used.The source for this data is William B. Dana Co., The Financial Review, New York: William B. Dana Co. (1872-1921) which reprinted data published by The Commercial and Financial Chronicle. <br />The Commercial Paper data for 1835 through 1871 are taken from Walter B. Smith and Arthur H. Cole, Fluctuations in American Business, Cambridge: Harvard Univ. Press, 1935, and the Broker Call money data are taken from F. R. Macaulay, The Movements of Interest Rates, Bond Yield, and Stock Prices in the United States since 1856, New York: National Bureau of Economic Research, 1938. Yields on Treasury nominal securities at 'constant maturity' are interpolated by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve for non-inflation-indexed Treasury securities. This curve, which relates the yield on a security to its time to maturity, is based on the closing market bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market. <br />These market yields are calculated from composites of quotations obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The constant maturity yield values are read from the yield curve at fixed maturities, currently 1, 3 and 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10 and 20 years. This method provides a yield for a 10-year maturity, for example, even if no outstanding security has exactly 10 years remaining to maturity. Similarly, yields on inflation-indexed securities at 'constant maturity' are interpolated from the daily yield curve for Treasury inflation protected securities in the over-the-counter market. The inflation-indexed constant maturity yields are read from this yield curve at fixed maturities, currently 5, 7, 10, and 20 years. Yields on treasury securities at constant, fixed maturity are constructed by the treasury department, based on the most actively traded marketable Treasury securities. Yields on these issues are based on composite quotes reported by U.S. government securities dealers to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. To obtain the constant maturity yields, personnel at treasury construct a yield curve each business day and yield values are then read from the curve at fixed maturities.Although the bond yield calculated by the Fed uses a constant maturity bond which is always exactly ten years from maturity, because the Fed does not provide the coupon on the underlying securities for their constant maturity yield, it is not possible to provide the duration.",
